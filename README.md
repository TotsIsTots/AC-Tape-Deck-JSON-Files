AC Tape deck is an app that plays hourly music. Here I have files that the app can use to play the Animal Crossing soundtracks. Note that Population Growing does not have weather based music.

# Instructions
1. Click on the json file of the music you want to add.
2. Click the three dots above the file, then click view raw.
3. Copy the url of the file.
4. In AC Tape Deck, go to "Select Music".
5. Click where you want to add the corresponding music file, then click any of the hours.
6. Click "From File".
7. Click "Import Music" and enter the copied url.
8. Click "OK" and enjoy!
